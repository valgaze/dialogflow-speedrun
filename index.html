# Resources

Learning DialogFlow is very much a team sport. Below's a highlight reel of excellent DialogFlow resources, both official & unofficial:

- [Libraries](#Libraries)

- [Official Samples](#Official-Samples)

- [Great 3rd Party Resources](#Great-3rd-Party-Resources)


## Libraries

**[NodeJS Client for DialogFlow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dialogflow)** Use this library if you want to control each "turn" of the conversation (ie you're responsible for POST'ing user text to DialogFlow's API, get the response, render it, etc etc)

* Source: https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-dialogflow 

* Documentation: https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/dialogflow/latest/index.html

**[DialogFlow-fulfillment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dialogflow-fulfillment)** This is a library for **["fulfillment"](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-overview)**(where DialogFlow calls into your system's webhook to retrieve data or perform some work.) This is also what DialogFlow's **[inline editor](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-inline-editor)** uses for fulfillment code. Note that **[as of January 2020](https://github.com/dialogflow/dialogflow-fulfillment-nodejs/commit/86a844a34ce61a665fa3687afe91af68b3dca0b8)** it is no longer maintained.

* Documentation: https://blog.dialogflow.com/post/fulfillment-library-beta/

**[actions-on-google](https://www.npmjs.com/package/actions-on-google)** Use this ONLY if you're planning on building an agent that works with Google Assistant. actions-on-google has a slighlty different syntax than dialogflow-fulfillment and its rich components (cards, suggeestion chips, carousel, etc) will not render on any non-Google Assistant device/interface. 

* Source: https://github.com/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs/tree/master/src/service/dialogflow 

* Documentation: https://actions-on-google.github.io/actions-on-google-nodejs/2.12.0/index.html

* Documentation 2: https://developers.google.com/assistant/actions/reference/nodejsv2/overview

* Example (actions-on-google + dialogflow-fulfillment): https://github.com/dialogflow/fulfillment-actions-library-nodejs/blob/master/functions/index.js

* Rich media JSON payloads (actions-on-google only): https://github.com/dialogflow/fulfillment-webhook-json
