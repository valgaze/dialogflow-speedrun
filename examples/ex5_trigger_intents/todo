Talk about intent "triggering" and how in DialogFlow you usually provide "hints" rather than explicitly linking conversations together
- Only users trigger intents (usually)

- Input & output context
    - Ex. parent intent

- Events
    EX. parent intent in fulfillment that triggers a child intent 
    w/ an Events

- Follow up intents
    - {{screen}}
    - Looks nice in interface & it wires up input + output intents for you
    - It's a convenience feature, that's all
