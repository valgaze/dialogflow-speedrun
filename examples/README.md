## Examples

Each example in this directory will typically contain three items:

* **examplename.intent.js**: Fulfillment code for the intnet

* **Archive.zip**: Intents & any associated entity/context/event/parameter options that you would ordinarily get setup in the **[DialogFlow Web Console](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/console)** or via the **[API](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/manage-intents)**

* **agent_unzip**: Directory with the contents of what's inside each example's Archive.zip (provided as a time-saver to quickly take a peek inside the Archive.zip)


Consult "**[Running The Examples](../docs/running_the_examples.md)**" for instructions how to run the examples & see each example's README for any call-outs
